# P038
Ephemeral Reward Task


This is the main code for Dr. Marco Vasconcelos's P038 forced choice in the
ephemeral choice task that was run in the summer of 2023 when he was on 
sabbatical at UCLA. The experiment had two main session types: 
    
  1)  Instrumental pre-training: one of the two b/y stimuli were placed either
      on the left or right part of the screen and a single peck to either
      lead to reinforcement and the following trial. 
      
  2) Training in Ephemeral Reward: pigeons were split into two groups: one
      that recieved forced choice trials with a single option at a time 
      and one that only recieved choices between the sub/optimal choice
      alternatives. The "optimal" key allowed the pigeons to pick a second
      reinforcer for each trial, while the "suboptimal" key limited them
      to a single reinforcer each trial. Keys were quasi-randomly assigned
      left and right each trial and were differntiable via their color (either
      blue or yellow), which was counterbalanced across subjects. Subjects in
      the forced condition recieved a mixture of choice trials and forced
      suboptimal and optimal trials. Subject assignments were tracked and 
      differentiable via a .csv document within the same directory.
        
Pre-training sessions consisted of 60 reinforced trials within a session, while
each training session was made up of two sub-sessions (40 trials each) each day
with a 10 m ITI seperating the two. Pigeons were not removed from their boxes
during this interval.
